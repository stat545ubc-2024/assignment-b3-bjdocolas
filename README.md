# Assignment B-3 

## What is this repository?
This repo was created for UBC's STAT545 course. It contains information and files for assignment B-3.

## What can I find in this repo?
[This](https://bjensendoc.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-bjdocolas/) is the link to a running instance of my app that was created for assignment-b3 for STAT545. 

In the [assignment-b3-bjdocolas folder](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2024/assignment-b3-bjdocolas/tree/main/assignment-b3-bjdocolas) you will find the [app.R code](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2024/assignment-b3-bjdocolas/blob/main/assignment-b3-bjdocolas/app.R) for the shiny app and the [.csv dataset file](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2024/assignment-b3-bjdocolas/blob/main/assignment-b3-bjdocolas/dataset/amazon_bestsellers.csv). The app.R code will be important for understanding which features are included in the shiny app for this assignment. The shinyapp.io link can also be found here under the [rsconnect folder](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2024/assignment-b3-bjdocolas/tree/main/assignment-b3-bjdocolas/rsconnect/shinyapps.io/bjensendoc).

## What is assignment-b3?
This assignment has the student create their own shiny app. For my app, an open source [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019) from Kaggle was used, that was created by Sooter Saalu titled "Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009-2019". 

## What is the purpose of this shiny app?
This app can be used to help you find your next book to read! The user can filter the top 50 bestselling books on Amazon based on year (2009-2019), genre (fiction vs. non-fiction), and price ($0-$35). They will then be able to see the results visually through a histogram plot, or in an interactive table format. The results table can also be downloaded as a .csv file.
